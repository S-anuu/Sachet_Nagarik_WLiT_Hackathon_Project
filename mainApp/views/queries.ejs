            <p>Nepal has made significant strides in women's rights, but challenges remain. Some key points:

                1. The 2015 Constitution guarantees equal rights to women and prohibits gender-based discrimination.
                2. Nepal has achieved near gender parity in primary education enrollment.
                3. The country has mandated 33% representation of women in the national parliament.
                4. However, issues like child marriage, domestic violence, and the practice of Chhaupadi (isolating menstruating women) persist, especially in rural areas.
                5. Women's participation in the formal workforce remains low, at around 26%.
    
                While legal protections have improved, cultural norms and implementation of laws continue to be obstacles in achieving full gender equality in Nepal.</p>

            <p>The gender pay gap refers to the difference in average earnings between men and women in the workforce. It still exists in many countries today and in Nepal too. For example, in the US, women earn about 82 cents for every dollar earned by men in comparable positions. This gap is influenced by factors such as discrimination, occupational segregation, and differences in work hours due to family responsibilities.</p>
